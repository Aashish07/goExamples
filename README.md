# goExamples
Here I am going to add examples and description elaborating each one for making go easy

go is actually a compiled language

What that means is that before we can actually execute this code , we need to transale it into information the computer can understand.

Go run automatically compiles that for us and then runs that compiled file. 
Command used is go run (filename.go)

but if we want to build it(compile it), we use go build (filename.go)
